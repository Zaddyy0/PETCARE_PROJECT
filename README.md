Dashboard: After logging in, you'll see the main dashboard displaying all your pet profiles.

Add a Pet: Navigate to the "Add Pet" page using the header navigation. Fill out the form and click "Create Pet Profile". Your new pet will appear on the dashboard.

View/Manage a Pet: Click on any pet card on the dashboard to go to their detailed profile page. From here, you can choose to Edit their details or Delete their profile.

📂 Project Structure
The project is organized into three core files to maintain separation of concerns:

.
├── 📄 index.html   # The main HTML file containing all page structures.
├── 🎨 style.css    # The custom stylesheet for animations and unique styles.
└── 🧠 app.js       # The main JavaScript file containing all application logic.

index.html: This is the single entry point for the application. It contains the HTML structure for all the different "pages" (Login, Dashboard, Add Pet, etc.) and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.

style.css: This file contains custom CSS rules that work alongside Tailwind CSS. It's primarily used for animations, scrollbar styling, and other visual effects that are easier to manage with custom CSS.

app.js: This is the heart of the application. It handles all dynamic behavior, including page navigation, managing pet and appointment data (state), rendering content, form submissions, and all user interactions like drag-and-drop.
